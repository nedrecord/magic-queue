      Answers to common questions about using Summon at the table.
    </p>

    <!-- How Summon Works -->
    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2 class="faq-section-title">How Summon Works</h2>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ What is Summon?</h3>
      <p>
        A simple table request system for magicians. People scan a code and you
        receive their table number in your queue.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ Do people need to install anything?</h3>
      <p>
        No. A phone camera and browser are all that’s required.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ Does Summon require an internet connection?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Summon is web based. Your device needs WiFi or cellular data for
        requests to appear.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ What if someone has weak signal?</h3>
      <p>
        If they can load the summon page once, the message displays. They only
        need enough service to reach that page.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ Can Summon be used offline?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Real-time requests require an active connection.
      </p>

    <!-- QR Codes and Table Requests -->
    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2 class="faq-section-title">QR Codes and Table Requests</h2>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ How many tables can Summon handle?</h3>
      <p>
        Up to 50. Each table has a unique QR code.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ What happens when someone scans the QR?</h3>
      <p>
        Their table number enters your queue, timestamped and sorted oldest to newest.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ What happens if someone repeatedly scans the same QR code?</h3>
      <p>
        Only that table’s timestamp updates. A spammer would effectively move
        themselves down the queue as newer tables come in.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ What does “Pause Queue” do?</h3>
      <p>
        It shows a short “brief pause” message instead
        of the normal confirmation. They are still added to your queue
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ How do I clear a table after visiting them?</h3>
      <p>
        Tap “Done” next to that table in the queue.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ Can multiple magicians use Summon in the same venue?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, as long as each magician has their own account. They’ll need to
        coordinate their own table numbering.
      </p>

    <!-- QR Codes, Printing, Placard Generator -->
    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2 class="faq-section-title">QR Codes, Printing, and the Placard Generator</h2>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ What are the QR codes for?</h3>
      <p>
        They route table requests into your queue.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ Can I re-download my QR codes later?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Summon does not store your QR images. If you lose them, you must
        generate new ones.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ What is the Placard Generator?</h3>
      <p>
        Many performers aren’t design-savvy, so Summon includes a simple tool
        that creates clean, printable table cards from your QR ZIP.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ I prefer to design my own signage. Is that allowed?</h3>
      <p>
        Of course. The Placard Generator is optional.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ What if someone scans one of my signs outside the venue?</h3>
      <p>
        It still triggers a table request. You should generally collect your
        placards after the gig unless the venue prints and manages their own signage.
      </p>

    <!-- Subscription and Billing -->
    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2 class="faq-section-title">Subscription and Billing</h2>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ How do I manage my subscription?</h3>
      <p>
        The Account page shows your email, subscription status, and renewal details.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ What happens when my subscription expires?</h3>
      <p>
        Your account becomes “Not subscribed” and the queue will not accept new
        table requests until you renew.
      </p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ Can Summon be used by a venue that hires different magicians?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, but each magician still needs their own individual account. Summon
        is currently structured around performer accounts rather than venue-wide logins.
      </p>

    <!-- Data and Privacy -->
    <section class="faq-section">
      <h2 class="faq-section-title">Data and Privacy</h2>

      <h3 class="faq-question">+ Does Summon sell or share data?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Only minimal operational data is stored, and none is sold or shared.
      </p>
